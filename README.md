EDA: 
* Initial EDA in order to dig deeper into our data
Housing Trends:
* PowerPoint deck we presented to our stakeholders (classmates, professor, and TAs)
Hypothesis 1:
* Further EDA and statistical Analysis for Hypothesis 1
  * Scatterplot of Average SF House Value vs Median Household Income for each year 2013-2019
  * Boxplots displaying the Affordability Trend over Time for each year 2013-2019
  * Condensed line graph dipicting Affordability Trend over Time for each year 2013-2019
  * Anova testing
  * P-value testing
Hypothesis 2: 
* Further EDA and statistical Analysis for Hypothesis 2
  * Eplore measures of central tendency, min, max, and quartiles
  * Histograph depicting how Household Income is distributed throughout ZIP codes
  * Grouping data based on Household Income Category and Year
  * Merging Affordabilty data to main dataframe
