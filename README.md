## Group 6 (Carnotaurus)
Presented by: 
* Bradley Barker
* Yingying Li

## Background
For our project, we are trying to help local metro-Atlanta real estate investors understand housing market trends and find areas that are more affordable. We analyzed data from the Census Bureau and Zillow to test our two hypotheses.

## Research Question 1: Is housing becoming less affordable?

Hypothesis1 (H1): From 2013 to 2019, housing has become less affordable.

## Research Question 2: Does the housing affordability trend have the same effect on the areas with different income levels? 

Hypothesis2 (H2): The difference in affordability is increasing over the years between areas with lower household income and areas with higher household income.

## Repository Structure
